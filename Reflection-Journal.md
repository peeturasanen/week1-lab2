# Reflection

## Challenges Faced:
I was having problems with the powershell in vscode. My code wouldnt work in the powershell, but when I changed to javascript debug tool it worked there, and after that the code worked in powershell again which was weird.

## What Went Well and Lessons Learned:
I succesfully completed all the activities during class and learned how to do them now. Also got my copilot setup.

- Key Learning:

I learned how to use vscode more efficiently, for example how to easily comment things out with shift + alt + a. And ofcourse learned all the basic js and github things taught in class.

## Online Resources:
I found this youtuber called "coder coder" who makes really great videos about coding, and those videos were really helpful.

## Coping Strategies:
- Academic Progress:

I got all the activities done and those really together with the videos helped me to start piecing this puzzle together of how everything works. That puzzle was previously not that clear to me.

- Soft Skills Development:

I communicated well in our group and we got all the activities. Regarding problem-solving I had to use the javascript debugger console to get my code working. 

## Project Management:
I dont really know how to answer to this. But we did great in our group.

## Final Thoughts:
Looking back on this week's experiences, I'm proud of my efforts in the Web Course and Project Course. Every challenge presented an opportunity to learn and grow, and I'm excited to continue building my skills and knowledge.

## Next Steps:
My main goal is to finish all the activities next week and watch the homework videos.
